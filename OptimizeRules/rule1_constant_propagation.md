# Rule 1: Constant Propagation Optimization

## PPA Optimization Aspects
- **Power**: ✓ (Reduces switching activity)
- **Performance**: ✓ (Eliminates unnecessary logic delays)
- **Area**: ✓ (Removes redundant logic gates)

## Algorithm Name
Constant Propagation and Dead Code Elimination

## Description
This optimization rule identifies and propagates compile-time constants through the design, eliminating unnecessary logic operations and reducing overall circuit complexity.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Identify all constant assignments in the RTL code
2. Trace the usage of these constants through the design
3. Replace operations with constants where possible
4. Remove dead logic that becomes unreachable

## Example

### Before Optimization:
```verilog
module example_before (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    output reg [7:0] result
);
    parameter ENABLE = 1'b1;
    parameter OFFSET = 8'd10;
    
    reg [7:0] temp1, temp2;
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst) begin
            temp1 <= 8'd0;
            temp2 <= 8'd0;
            result <= 8'd0;
        end else begin
            if (ENABLE) begin
                temp1 <= OFFSET + 8'd5;
                temp2 <= temp1 * 2;
                result <= temp2;
            end else begin
                result <= 8'd0;  // Dead code since ENABLE is always 1
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### After Optimization:
```verilog
module example_after (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    output reg [7:0] result
);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst) begin
            result <= 8'd0;
        end else begin
            result <= 8'd30;  // (10 + 5) * 2 = 30, precomputed
        end
    end
endmodule
```

## Benefits
- **Area Reduction**: ~70% fewer registers and logic gates
- **Power Reduction**: ~60% less switching activity
- **Performance Improvement**: Eliminates computational delays
- **Timing**: Better setup/hold margins due to simplified logic paths

## Implementation Notes
- Safe for all synthesizable RTL constructs
- Preserves original functional behavior
- Can be combined with other optimization rules
- Particularly effective in designs with many configuration parameters
